Part 2: Create a simple page and style it with CSS

In the HTML file, create a mockup of a homepage for your portfolio. This should include at least:
A link element in the head that links to your style.css
Your name
A navigation bar
Sample text (this can be filler for now)
At least one image
At least 2 div elements
As a mockup, your navigation bar does not need to link to anything yet and your text can be filler text. The focus here is to create a basic HTML structure you can modify with CSS. The more HTML elements  you have, the more options you will have in styling.

Part 2: Create a simple page and style it with CSS
In the CSS file, use selectors and descriptors to modify your HTML page. Before you start though, pick a color scheme for your page using 3-5 colors (https://coolors.co/ is a great resource) and at least one font from Google Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/. This is a guide for using Google Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/using_type/using_web_fonts_from_a_font_delivery_service
Your CSS should include the following:
Font
P and A element selectors
Div selectors
Modifications to font color and size
Modifications to spacing using “padding” and “margins”
The focus here should not be to arbitrarily use the above items but rather to create a cohesive visual style using CSS and the fonts and colors you chose above.
